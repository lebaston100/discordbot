If you want 1080p, on compatible/newer iOS devices, you can use the &codec=vp8 to get 1080p capture -- however a older iPhone like a 6S,  might not be realistic as it will use the CPU to encode... and an iPhone 6S might struggle there. iPhones don't handle large group rooms that well, especially older iPhones. iPhone is limited to 3 h264 streams",

Remember that OBS.Ninja is a peer to peer n-to-n connection. Meaning if you have 5 people in a room, all 5 people will be connecting to other 4. This can severely limit your options, since every connection is a new encoding load. There are ways to optimize CPU usage by reducing total room bitrate, or outputting only the OBS feed into a room, and feeding that to all guests. Check !advanced for more info.",

The Electron Capture app works better than OBS if packet loss is an issue.\nBe sure to rule out non-internet issues like the guest being on low battery or in dim-environments causing low frame rates on many laptops.\nIf using the !electron capture app, adding &buffer=200 can help mitigate some issues.\nIf using OBS, try switching the video codec by using &codec=vp9 or &codec=h264 on the view link.\n\nWatch this video to learn more about how to reduce packet loss: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je2ljlvLzlY",

If not... well:\n- Use the !electron capture app instead of OBS, then window capture it into OBS.\n- If using the !electron capture app, you can do &buffer=200 to mitigate issues\n- If Packet Loss is hurting your stream (test at !speedtest), try using Speedify - <https://speedify.com>. It can help, especially if you can bond WiFi with LTE. (Redundant / bonded mode)\n- Try adding '&privacy' to your URL which might reduce packet loss.\n- Physically move closer to your router.\n- Don't have more clients on the network; put others on LTE if you must be on WiFi\n- If you can, don't be on battery, connect your device.\n- Don't expect flawless  high resolution, high bitrate feeds. Reduce your requirements. Try 720p or even lower.\n- Consider limiting FPS\n- VP9 or H264 works better than VP8 within OBS\n- Avoid bluetooth.\n- Be ready to 'reconnect' failed audio connections/tracks\n- Close all other non essential apps",
