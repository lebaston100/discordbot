This can severely limit your options, since every connection is a new encoding load. There are ways to optimize CPU usage by reducing total room bitrate, or outputting only the OBS feed into a room, and feeding that to all guests. Check !advanced for more info.",

Reduce your requirements. Try 720p or even lower.\n- Consider limiting FPS\n- VP9 or H264 works better than VP8 within OBS\n- Avoid bluetooth.\n- Be ready to 'reconnect' failed audio connections/tracks\n- Close all other non essential apps",
